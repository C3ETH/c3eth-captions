00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:08,833
Hello This  is “Eastern Townhall Team Operation” Team!

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,333
Our Problem statement is that

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:21,125
Participating in Catalyst is difficult when you live in the 
eastern time zone and your language is not English.

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:25,541
For example, in a survey conducted by the Japanese 
community.

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:32,000
half said that lack of translation was the biggest problem 
for Catalyst.

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:39,541
Normal town halls are in the eastern hemisphere at midnight.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:48,416
And, Thirty percent of Japanese voting participants vote 
randomly without thinking just to get paid.

8
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:57,833
The solution to that is Eastern Townhall supports eastern 
countries with events, and translating content.

9
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:08,208
The aim is to increase participants by 20% for each fund.

10
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:15,333
As a related experience our team is made up of people from 
diverse backgrounds.

11
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:21,500
Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst 
School. 

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,291
T & Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East 
Asia & Japan.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,291
This activity has already begun and the sixth meetup has 
already taken place.

14
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,625
Again, Due to linguistic barriers, a survey of the Japanese 
community

15
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:46,666
that 30% of voters vote randomly without looking at the 
proposal.

16
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:55,541
The fact that East Asia is the birthplace of Cardano and has
 many ADAs

17
00:01:55,541 --> 00:02:05,375
Given these, helping the Eastern Hemisphere participate in 
Catalyst is a very urgent and important issue for the honest

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:14,750
Proposers of the Not only for the eastern hemisphere but 
also for the western hemisphere.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,125
We will increase the quantity and quality of participants in
 the Eastern Hemisphere region.

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:32,083
Thank you for the opportunity to present at the wonderful 
summit. Let's liven up Catalyst together! Thank you.
