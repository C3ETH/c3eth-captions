Hello everyone my name is Mie and I am from Vietnam.

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:12,500
My name is Tien and I'm from Vietnam. We are part of the 
Cardano Eastern Townhall 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,625
Also the moderator and translator of the Vietnam Townhall.

4
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:26,083
Itâ€™s exciting that Cardano has spread its wing to East Asia 
and create more opportunities and roles to equalize

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,083
the community and build up the decentralization system. 

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,583
It connects East Asia with the world.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,833
Catalyst project is growing fast with the number of 
proposals increasing double every fund

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:45,250
if we could optimize all the votes from ADA holders, the 
chance you get funded for a project is higher. 

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,541
Especially when the majority of the ADA holder is in Asia

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:54,291
However, there is a language barrier for those non-native 
English-speaking countries. 

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:01:00,500
It is difficult for them to fully understand the insight of 
the proposal and might easily overlook them

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,958
and only vote along with the crowd.

13
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:08,458
Our proposal is "Connecting Asian Voters and Proposers."

14
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:17,125
Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage 
for voter and proposer onboarding. 

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,666
To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together by
 building trust between them. 

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,833
This can be approached in many ways help ADA holders 
understand why it is important to vote

17
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:35,666
give translation guidelines, socialize content, and conduct 
routine surveys.

18
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:41,958
I believe there will be many efficient ways to achieve the 
goal and you might be the one to bring it up. 

19
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:47,750
So help us improve decision-making across the Eastern 
Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,083
Thank you very much
