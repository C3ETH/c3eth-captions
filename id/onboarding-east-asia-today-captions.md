1 00:00:05,625 --&gt; 00:00:10,333 Kia ora koutou katoa, saya Robert O'Brien, anggota tim Eastern Town Hall,

2 00:00:10,333 --&gt; 00:00:12,291 from Aotearoa, New Zealand.

3 00:00:12,916 --&gt; 00:00:19,250 Dalam tantangan Fund 6, sumber dokumen multibahasa, Eastern Town Hall memiliki proposal “Onboarding East Asia Today!”

4 00:00:19,666 --&gt; 00:00:21,833 Asia is culturally diverse.

5 00:00:21,833 --&gt; 00:00:26,541 The language, customs, technology adoption, and economic development covers the spectrum.

6 00:00:27,458 --&gt; 00:00:28,708 Two things stand out though.

7 00:00:28,958 --&gt; 00:00:29,500 First.

8 00:00:30,166 --&gt; 00:00:32,333 Kecakapan bahasa Inggris yang berbeda-beda.

9 00:00:32,333 --&gt; 00:00:35,375 Across Asia, English is not widely spoken,

10 00:00:35,958 --&gt; 00:00:39,000 rather a web of regional dialects are used instead.

11 00:00:39,750 --&gt; 00:00:44,750 Kedua, komunitas di seluruh Asia ingin terlibat dalam ekosistem Cardano.

12 00:00:45,208 --&gt; 00:00:51,458 Misalnya, meskipun populasinya besar, hanya segelintir proposal dari wilayah ini yang telah mengajukan ke Project Catalyst.

13 00:00:51,833 --&gt; 00:00:55,750 The language barrier introduces friction, reducing participation.

14 00:00:56,375 --&gt; 00:01:01,875 We want to embrace the energy and perspectives of non-English speaking communities across Cardano.

15 00:01:02,291 --&gt; 00:01:08,958 A step toward that is to translate and localise content into the languages of the East Asian region and beyond.

16 00:01:08,958 --&gt; 00:01:11,250 Or go the other way, into English.

17 00:01:11,250 --&gt; 00:01:12,500 That is not a small undertaking.

18 00:01:13,208 --&gt; 00:01:19,708 Our proposal is seeking funding to build and document an open-source streamlined process for content translation.

19 00:01:19,708 --&gt; 00:01:22,791 To coordinate and make the translation process easier.

20 00:01:22,791 --&gt; 00:01:25,125 To do that we're setting up a workflow with the aim of

21 00:01:25,125 --&gt; 00:01:32,750 getting the community at large to translate documentation, guides and, yes, Catalyst proposals.

22 00:01:32,750 --&gt; 00:01:39,500 We already have a simple process set up using open-source development tools - git, Hugo and GitHub actions.

23 00:01:39,500 --&gt; 00:01:46,291 Our new website is constantly evolving and we are translating the content as we go with these tools.

24 00:01:46,291 --&gt; 00:01:48,041 Learning by doing.

25 00:01:48,333 --&gt; 00:01:53,958 Try it out and view this proposal in English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.

26 00:01:54,250 --&gt; 00:01:57,750 This video also has captions for all those languages too.

27 00:01:58,625 --&gt; 00:02:01,583 And each fund 6 proposal that you'll find on our website,

28 00:02:02,041 --&gt; 00:02:02,541 Well,

29 00:02:02,791 --&gt; 00:02:07,875 mereka dikembangkan, diusulkan, dan disajikan dengan perspektif anggota tim Eastern Town Hall kami.

30 00:02:08,291 --&gt; 00:02:10,708 Designed to meet our local needs.

31 00:02:10,875 --&gt; 00:02:15,625 We want to do more, so we need to improve upon our current practice.

32 00:02:15,625 --&gt; 00:02:22,791 Cardano and Catalyst content grows with every fund so automating as much as possible helps us scale.

33 00:02:22,791 --&gt; 00:02:28,791 We want to queue up a piece of work for translation and enable everyone and anyone to contribute.

34 00:02:29,250 --&gt; 00:02:33,166 That way we can leverage the communities talent and knowledge to help.

35 00:02:33,416 --&gt; 00:02:39,333 But we have to start small first, experiment, and find what works before scaling out.

36 00:02:39,333 --&gt; 00:02:42,666 The Eastern Townhall is a collaborative effort.

37 00:02:42,958 --&gt; 00:02:46,791 The team represents a wealth of cultural and technical expertise.

38 00:02:47,208 --&gt; 00:02:51,666 Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Australia, New Zealand are all represented.

39 00:02:52,458 --&gt; 00:02:54,041 And more communities to come.

40 00:02:55,291 --&gt; 00:02:57,666 By virtue of running the Eastern Townhall, and other

41 00:02:57.666 --&gt; 00:03:01,583 kelompok komunitas lainnya, kita semua aktif dalam eksperimen Catalyst.

42 00:03:02,166 --&gt; 00:03:06,083 The team will be working on establishing a semi-automated translation pipeline.

43 00:03:06,416 --&gt; 00:03:08,208 Starting with Git and Github.

44 00:03:08,625 --&gt; 00:03:13,333 We also want to document the process to make it easier to train translators.

45 00:03:13,333 --&gt; 00:03:20,208 Documentation, tutorials, video content will play a pivotal in onboarding new people with diverse backgrounds.

46 00:03:20,750 --&gt; 00:03:26,625 Bersamaan dengan kita melakukan, kami akan mulai menambahkan lebih banyak bahasa, meminta anggota komunitas Cardano untuk membantu.

47 00:03:27,208 --&gt; 00:03:30,291 Dalam jangka panjang, proyek itu sendiri dapat mandiri.

48 00:03:30,291 --&gt; 00:03:37,083 Leveraging our expertise and services to other projects, proposals, DAO's or traditional businesses even.

49 00:03:37,083 --&gt; 00:03:38,750 Why not learn and earn?

50 00:03:39,125 --&gt; 00:03:42,375 We have a blockchain accounting layer, so why not contribute

51 00:03:42,375 --&gt; 00:03:46,458 to the Cardano ecosystem via completion of translations tasks,

52 00:03:46,458 --&gt; 00:03:49,833 learn at the same time, and earn some coin.

53 00:03:49,833 --&gt; 00:03:51,958 Seperti apa kesuksesan itu,

54 00:03:51,958 --&gt; 00:03:58,250 our metrics will be defined by the project's velocity and engagement happening during and after the initial funding.

55 00:03:58,541 --&gt; 00:04:04,500 Karena kami menggunakan alat kolaborasi untuk perencanaan dan dokumentasi kami, metrik diambil dari aktivitas yang

56 00:04:04,500 --&gt; 00:04:06,166 recorded with these tools.

57 00:04:06,375 --&gt; 00:04:08,500 We can also track project contributions.

58 00:04:09,416 --&gt; 00:04:11,041 At least some aspects of it.

59 00:04:11,041 --&gt; 00:04:17,041 So perhaps we'll start issuing NFT Badges for representing language skills and contributions to the community.

60 00:04:17,541 --&gt; 00:04:18,416 In summary,

61 00:04:18,625 --&gt; 00:04:23,125 we will be building a translation pipeline to help engage with East Asian communities.

62 00:04:23,791 --&gt; 00:04:26,875 Bridging the language and cultural barriers in our ecosystem.

63 00:04:27,500 --&gt; 00:04:32,208 Helping us to participate and contribute to the success of the Cardano network.
