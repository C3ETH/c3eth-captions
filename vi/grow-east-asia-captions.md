The grow east asia grow, cardano proposal is for me.

4
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:15,875
one of the most important proposed categories in fund 7.

01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:23,416
As a moderator of the eastern townhall. I meet every day 
with experienced bright creatives who have unique solutions

6
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:27,500
 that fit the needs of their local economies and culture.

7
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:35,083
Everything from the complex distributed exchanges and NFT 
product that address food traceablity.

8
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:39,208
With a mixture of, on the one hand a mature economy of Japan
  

9
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:43,833
and areas of hyper-growth on the other like Vietnam and 
Indonesia. 

10
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:47,916
South East Asia is the perfect place to extend the reach of 
Cardano.

11
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:52,125
South East Asia's rich and diverse cultures and economic 
systems

12
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:56,458
really warrant having there own fun that target local 
challenges.

13
01:00:56,458 --> 01:01:00,791
If you agree please vote for grow south east asia grow 
cardano.
