vietnam indonesia and so many other

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,680
countries

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
our challenge theme is the category

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,719
proposal outreach with our requested

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,879
funds of twenty thousand dollars

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,360
this proposal is a joint effort by

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,239
various project catalyst veteran

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,480
community members that have converged

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
and collaborated on the creation of the

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,559
eastern town hall

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,879
you can communicate with us freely at

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,879
our various communication channels you

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,760
can find in our slide

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,240
eastern town hall foundations is the

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,320
embryo of this proposal

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
the problem that we have clearly

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,200
identified is that there are no

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,799
initiatives to attract and engage east

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
asian entrepreneurs

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
where they are in their local language

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,360
this can simply be seen in the

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
participation of east asian

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,439
entrepreneurs in project catalyst fund

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
six although a record-breaking 800 plus

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,720
proposal submitted

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,200
there was only 17 proposals from vietnam

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,640
seven from japan and only one from

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,680
indonesia a country with 52 million

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,159
economically secured citizens

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
our thoughtful solution to this problem

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,200
is by using the eastern town hall and

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,759
various specifically targeted virtual

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,040
network of east asian entrepreneurs

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
we want to reach their massive untapped

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,159
potential

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,600

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,759
