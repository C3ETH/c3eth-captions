00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:10,333
Kia ora koutou katoa, I'm Robert O'Brien, a member of the 
Eastern Townhall team. 

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,291
from Aotearoa, New Zealand.

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:19,250
In the fund 6 multilingual resources challenge the Eastern 
Townhall has the proposal “Onboarding East Asia Today!”

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,833
Asia is culturally diverse. 

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:26,541
The language, customs, technology adoption, and economic 
development covers the spectrum. 

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,708
Two things stand out though.

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:29,500
First.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,333
First, English proficiency is mixed. 

9
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,375
Across Asia, English is not widely spoken, 

10
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,000
rather a web of regional dialects are used instead.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
Second, Communities across Asia want to get involved in the 
Cardano ecosystem. 

12
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:51,458
For example, despite a large population, few proposals from 
our region have been submitted to Catalyst.

13
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,750
The language barrier introduces friction, reducing 
participation.

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:01,875
We want to embrace the energy and perspectives of 
non-English speaking communities across Cardano.

15
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:08,958
A step toward that is to translate and localise content into
 the languages of the East Asian region and beyond.

16
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,250
Or go the other way, into English.

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,500
That is not a small undertaking.

18
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:19,708
Our proposal is seeking funding to build and document an 
open-source streamlined process for content translation.

19
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,791
To coordinate and make the translation process easier.

20
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,125
To do that we're setting up a workflow with the aim of

21
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:32,750
getting the community at large to translate documentation, 
guides and, yes, Catalyst proposals.

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,500
We already have a simple process set up using open-source 
development tools - git, Hugo and GitHub actions. 

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,291
Our new website is constantly evolving and we are 
translating the content as we go with these tools. 

24
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,041
Learning by doing.

25
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:53,958
Try it out and view this proposal in English, Japanese, 
Korean, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,750
This video also has captions for all those languages too.

27
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,583
And each fund 6 proposal that you'll find on our website, 

28
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:02,541
Well,

29
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,875
They were developed, proposed and presented with the 
perspectives of our Eastern townhall team members. 

30
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,708
Designed to meet our local needs.

31
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:15,625
We want to do more, so we need to improve upon our current 
practice.

32
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:22,791
Cardano and Catalyst content grows with every fund so 
automating as much as possible helps us scale.

33
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:28,791
We want to queue up a piece of work for translation and 
enable everyone and anyone to contribute.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,166
That way we can leverage the communities talent and 
knowledge to help.

35
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:39,333
But we have to start small first, experiment, and find what 
works before scaling out.

36
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,666
The Eastern Townhall is a collaborative effort. 

37
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,791
The team represents a wealth of cultural and technical 
expertise. 

38
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,666
Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Australia, New Zealand are
 all represented. 

39
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,041
And more communities to come. 

40
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,666
By virtue of running the Eastern Townhall, and other

41
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,583
community groups, we are all active in the Catalyst 
experiment. 

42
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:06,083
The team will be working on establishing a semi-automated 
translation pipeline.

43
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,208
Starting with Git and Github. 

44
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:13,333
We also want to document the process to make it easier to 
train translators. 

45
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:20,208
Documentation, tutorials, video content will play a 
pivotal in onboarding new people with diverse backgrounds. 

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,625
As we do, we'll start to add more languages, getting members
 of the Cardano community to help out.

47
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,291
Long-term the project itself can be self-sustaining.

48
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:37,083
Leveraging our expertise and services to other projects, 
proposals, DAO's or traditional businesses even. 

49
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,750
Why not learn and earn?  

50
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,375
We have a blockchain accounting layer, so why not contribute
 

51
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,458
to the Cardano ecosystem via completion of translations 
tasks,

52
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,833
 learn at the same time, and earn some coin.

53
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,958
In terms of what success looks like

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:58,250
our metrics will be defined by the project's velocity and 
engagement happening during and after the initial funding.

55
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:04,500
Since we’re using collaboration tools for our planning and 
documentation, the metrics are derived from activity 

56
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,166
recorded with these tools. 

57
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,500
We can also track project contributions.

58
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
At least some aspects of it.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:17,041
So perhaps we'll start issuing NFT Badges for representing 
language skills and contributions to the community. 

60
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,416
In summary,

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,125
we will be building a translation pipeline to help engage 
with East Asian communities. 

62
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,875
Bridging the language and cultural barriers in our 
ecosystem.

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,208
Helping us to participate and contribute to the success of 
the Cardano network.
